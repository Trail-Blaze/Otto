## The NO Spyware, NO Adware, NO Nonsense Launcher

Otto is a custom launcher for Fortnite. It does exactly as advertised and does exactly what it was intended to do. There is **ZERO spyware, ZERO Ads, and ZERO malware/cryptojacking software** embedded in this application when compared to other alternatives such as [Neonite](https://github.com/NeoniteDev) or StormFN.

Which means that you can lay down in bed soundly knowing that your computer is **NOT** now infested with horrible, horrible malware just waiting for you to open it once more.



> **NOTE** That this is a [live build](https://trail-blaze.github.io/Otto/) (Don't click on that link, it won't work in your browser). The development client build will refresh as that magic page updates.
> This means that whatever changes are posted on this branch will be reflected in the client
